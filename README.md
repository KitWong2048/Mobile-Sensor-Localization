# Mobile-Sensor-Localization
## Description
The code implement the mobile sensor localization algorithm presented in
Hu, Lingxuan, and David Evans. "Localization for mobile sensor networks." Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking. ACM, 2004.

The algorithm tracks the locations of moving sensors using Particle Filter in an adhoc network  continuously.

## How to
